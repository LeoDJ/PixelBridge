# modLED PixelBridge
A modular software that can accept image data from multiple sources, convert them and send them to a sink.  
Management of sources and sinks can be done via a web interface.

It's targeted to do the image data conversion for the [modLED project](https://github.com/opendata-heilbronn/modLED).


## How to run
Run with `npm start` (don't forget to run `npm i` the first time).

## Development
Develop with `npm run dev`. Then access http://localhost:8081 for the development frontend. (Port 8080 will still host the outdated release frontend)
